#### Settings Module

* Copy settings.ini.example to settings.ini
```console
cp settings.ini.example settings.ini
```
* Update the AWS credentials in settings.ini
* Update the DEV_MODE in settings.ini. Turning DEV_MODE on makes requests to the local version of each AWS service. Look at each module on how to mimick the service locally.
